# Java Stack Implementation

This repository contains a simple Java implementation of a stack data structure with push and pop operations. A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Overview

In computer science, a stack is a linear data structure that can be thought of as a collection of items with two main operations:

1. **Push:** This operation adds an item to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop:** This operation removes and returns the item from the top of the stack.

This repository provides a basic Java implementation of a stack using an array.

## Usage

To use this Java stack implementation in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-stack.git
   ```

2. Include the `Stack.java` file in your project.

3. Create an instance of the `Stack` class:

   ```java
   Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
   ```

4. Push elements onto the stack using the `push` method:

   ```java
   stack.push(42);
   stack.push(10);
   stack.push(23);
   ```

5. Pop elements from the stack using the `pop` method:

   ```java
   int poppedElement = stack.pop(); // Returns 23
   ```

6. You can also check if the stack is empty using the `isEmpty` method:

   ```java
   boolean isEmpty = stack.isEmpty(); // Returns false
   ```

7. To retrieve the top element of the stack without removing it, you can use the `peek` method:

   ```java
   int topElement = stack.peek(); // Returns 10 (the top element without removing it)
   ```

8. Experiment with other methods provided by the `Stack` class as needed.

## Implementation Details

The stack implementation in this repository uses a simple array to store the elements. Some key points about the implementation:

- The size of the array is dynamic and grows as needed to accommodate more elements.
- The `push` operation adds elements to the top of the stack.
- The `pop` operation removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.
- The `peek` operation allows you to view the top element without removing it.
- The `isEmpty` operation checks whether the stack is empty.
